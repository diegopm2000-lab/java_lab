# Spring autowiring

Using autowiring in xml beans to reference another beans

We use byName (matching by id of the bean in beans.xml) or byType (matching by type of the bean in beans.xml)

There is another wiring using "constructor". For this option, we will need to define a constructor in the Bean.
